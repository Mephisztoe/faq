## Answer
Starting with version 1.3.3, it's possible to run the German Middleware 1.3.3 on Linux and MacOs, using [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/). Just configure a Cashbox and download the Linux launcher via the respective button in the Cashbox overview. Like on Windows, the downloaded zip file contains scripts to install and test the Middleware.
