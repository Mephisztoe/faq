### Repeat invitation of a PosOperator by the PosDealer

#### Option 1: Repeat the automatically sent e-mail ![img](..\images\PosOperator\PosOperator-repeat01.png)

![img](..\images\numbers\1.png) For each PosOperator who has not yet accepted the invitation or could not accept it, the status is indicated by this icon:![img](..\images\posoperator\envelope_red.png)

![img](..\images\numbers\2.png)By clicking on "Assign", the sending of the e-mail-invitation can be repeated.

![temp](..\images\numbers\3.png)If this automatically sent e-mail does not arrive at the PosOperator, the log of assignments can be accessed by clicking on the "History" button. 

#### Option 2: Sending a manual e-mail by using the link

![img](..\images\numbers\1.png) By clicking on "Send invitation again" the automated e-mail can also be initiated via this button.

![img](..\images\numbers\2.png)By clicking on "Copy link to clipboard" button, the link to assign the PosOperator is copied to the clipboard. Subsequently, this link can be sent from the PosDealer to the PosOperator via another method - e.g. with an individual e-mail from the private e-mail-account of the PosDealer-employee.
